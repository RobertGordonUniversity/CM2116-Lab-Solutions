# CM2116 Lab Solutions

This repo will contain the solutions to each week's coding exercises. The structure is fairly simple - a folder for each lab, with each folder containing an `App.java` file with a `main()` method for running. Some labs will have all the code in the `App` class; others will have more classes added. 

## Updates

The repo will be updated each week. There's two ways you can use the repo and get the latest updates - cloning and pulling the updates, or forking and synching the updates. The former means you won't be able to push any updates you make to GitHub, while the latter will allow this.

### Cloning and pulling

This is the simplest way. Once you've cloned the repo and the project is open in Visual Studio Code, you can obtain the latest version by  opening the Source Control pane in Visual Studio Code, clicking the three dots at the top and clicking **Pull**. This will add the newest code. Alternatively, if you have the project open then running `git pull` in the terminal will have the same effect.

The disadvantage of this approach is that you can't commit and push your own changes so you'll need to keep your local copy somewhere safe.

### Forking

Forking the repo means an exact copy will be created in a new repo in your own GitHub account. This will allow you to push any changes you make (e.g., working on the suggested exercises). To fork the repo, click the **Fork** button in the top-right of the repo. Follow the instructions on the next page to create the fork. When done, you'll be taken to the forked repo. This is what you should now clone and work on.

To sync the changes from the main repo each week, visit your repo on GitHub and click the **Sync fork** button (under the green **Code** button), then click the **Update branch** button (if there's no updates, you'll see a message informing you of this).
